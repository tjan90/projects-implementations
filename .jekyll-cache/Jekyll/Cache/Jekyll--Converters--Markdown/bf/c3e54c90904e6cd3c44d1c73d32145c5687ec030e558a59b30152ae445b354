I"@<p>Provided models have been trained on 10.000 images 64x64, the dataset is custom made and based on <a href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html">CelebA</a> with a little modification.
In our project we had to find the best performing model by only looking at papers and testing it with 2 set of faces: <em>cropped</em> (as close to no-background as possible) and <em>large</em> (as much background as possible)

<ul>
  <li>Top row is the input images, the original ones that the NN has never seen before</li>
  <li>Second row is the noisy images, the input of our NNs</li>
  <li>Third row is the output images for the WIN5_LARGE model</li>
  <li>Fourth row is the out images for the WIN5 model</li>
