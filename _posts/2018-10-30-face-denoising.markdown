Provided models have been trained on 10.000 images 64x64, the dataset is custom made and based on [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) with a little modification.
In our project we had to find the best performing model by only looking at papers and testing it with 2 set of faces: *cropped* (as close to no-background as possible) and *large* (as much background as possible)
![Results table](https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV/blob/master/output.png)
- Top row is the input images, the original ones that the NN has never seen before
- Second row is the noisy images, the input of our NNs
- Third row is the output images for the WIN5_LARGE model
- Fourth row is the out images for the WIN5 model

We provide a [whitepaper](https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV/blob/master/whitepaper.pdf) for better understanding of the process that made this models possible.

### Models and Hardware requirements
The models have been trained on a nVidia Quadro P4000, each epochs took 93-95 seconds.

- ***WIN5*** model was trained for 75 epochs, ispired by [Peng Liu, Ruogu Fang](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09135)
- ***WIN5_BW*** model was trained for 25~ epochs
- ***WIN5_LARGE*** model was trained for 25 epochs
- ***DNCNN_BW*** was trained for 27~ epochs, inspired by [Kai Zhang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03981)
- ***DNCNN*** was trained for 25~ epochs

### How to run/install
To run the model trainer:
```
git clone https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV.git
cd Face-Denoising-CASACV
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model_trainer_edited.py
```

The dataset examples are in the `file dataset` folder, to generate them you can use the file `script.py` but you have to modify it based on what you need.
