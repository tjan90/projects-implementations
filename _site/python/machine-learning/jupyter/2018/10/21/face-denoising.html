    <p>Provided models have been trained on 10.000 images 64x64, the dataset is custom made and based on <a href="http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html">CelebA</a> with a little modification.
In our project we had to find the best performing model by only looking at papers and testing it with 2 set of faces: <em>cropped</em> (as close to no-background as possible) and <em>large</em> (as much background as possible)
<img src="https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV/blob/master/output.png" alt="Results table" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Top row is the input images, the original ones that the NN has never seen before</li>
  <li>Second row is the noisy images, the input of our NNs</li>
  <li>Third row is the output images for the WIN5_LARGE model</li>
  <li>Fourth row is the out images for the WIN5 model</li>
</ul>

<p>We provide a <a href="https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV/blob/master/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> for better understanding of the process that made this models possible.</p>

<h3 id="models-and-hardware-requirements">Models and Hardware requirements</h3>
<p>The models have been trained on a nVidia Quadro P4000, each epochs took 93-95 seconds.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>WIN5</em></strong> model was trained for 75 epochs, ispired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09135">Peng Liu, Ruogu Fang</a></li>
  <li><strong><em>WIN5_BW</em></strong> model was trained for 25~ epochs</li>
  <li><strong><em>WIN5_LARGE</em></strong> model was trained for 25 epochs</li>
  <li><strong><em>DNCNN_BW</em></strong> was trained for 27~ epochs, inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03981">Kai Zhang et al.</a></li>
  <li><strong><em>DNCNN</em></strong> was trained for 25~ epochs</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-runinstall">How to run/install</h3>
<p>To run the model trainer:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/JustAnOwlz/Face-Denoising-CASACV.git
cd Face-Denoising-CASACV
pip install -r requirements.txt
python model_trainer_edited.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The dataset examples are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">file dataset</code> folder, to generate them you can use the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">script.py</code> but you have to modify it based on what you need.</p>

<h3 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h3>
<p>The project was build from the ground up by our team:</p>
